This application is designed to provide users with insight into how U.S. real estate markets compare in terms of affordability and profitability. It also allows for easy comparison between locations and shows how a loan can be paid off over time, as well as how that affects the equity you build in your home.

Currently, the application calculates the user's down payment, closing costs, and the estimated mortgage for a property in the area of their choosing. The rest of the capabilities have not yet been added.

The [backend](https://github.com/Lsimelus/real-calc-script) for this application is a python flask app that will eventually get updated

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
